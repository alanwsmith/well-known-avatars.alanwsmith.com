- "ACCOUNT" - what/whoever's avatars are being served. 

- "CLIENT" - sites/networks/apps/RSS readers, 
  etc... that display the avatars.

- "DOMAIN" - the domain/subdomain hosting the
  AVATAR SET assets.

- "AVATAR SET" - A DEFAULT IMAGE and a MANIFEST FILE. 
  Notably, this DOES NOT include other image assets
  as those may be hosted in entirely different locations. 

- "DEFAULT IMAGE" - a JPEG encoded file that MUST BE named 
  `default.jpg`

- "MANIFEST FILE" - a JSON file that MUST BE named 
  `manifest.json` and MUST comply with the SCHEMA.

- "MANIFEST SCHEMA" - The JSON Schema for the MANIFEST FILE. 
  (This will be versioned, but details on that
  are for a future iteration). 

  (I'm not sure where the schema would be 
  hosted, but there will be an explicit URL for it)
