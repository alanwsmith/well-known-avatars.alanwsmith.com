  <summary>TL;DR</summary>

[! filter markdown|safe !]

- Server files statically in order to open access
to as many people as possilbe (e.g. folks that can't 
afford a server with dynamic processing should not be
left out of the feature).

- Provide `.well-known/avatars` for both DOMAINS
and ACCOUNTS. (e.g. so RSS readers can benefit
from the feature as well)

- Default images must be square .jpg files
and go to these locations for the DOMAIN
and ACCOUNTS respectively.

        /.well-known/avatars/default.jpg
        and
        /.well-known/avatars/UUID/default.jpg

- `manifest.json` files list other avatars that
are available. They reside at:

        /.well-known/avatars/manifest.json
        and
        /.well-known/avatars/UUID/manifest.json

- MANIFEST FILES include two categories of 
avatars: `default` and `custom`. 

  The `default` avatars are intended to be used
generically. The `custom` avatars are to provide
the ability for folks to maintain multiple 
avatars in their own centralized location if
they want to use more than one (e.g. so
folks don't have to use the same avatar
on LinkedIn that they use on Mastodon.)

- Tags are used to communicate intent
for which images go where beyond the 
defaults.

- Don't use image sizes, just use ratios.
 
- Add a field for Alt Text

- Provide for animated avatars as well
