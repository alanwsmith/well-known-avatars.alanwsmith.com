- My site is twenty-five years old. I approach this
  kind of exercise by thinking about the next twenty-five.
  It's a fools errand. A prime opportunity
  for premature optimization. It's also
  an important part of my process. 
  It boils down to the idea that 
  "Temporary ain't^^tmp^^". The more folks
  involved in a thing, the more likely it is
  we'll only get one shot at it. 

- I'm using SHOULD/MUST/MAY style, but only
loosely as a framework to help writing
and to have something to react to. 
Coming up with a conforming spec/RFC
is an exercise for a later time. 

- I'm specifying the default images should be ".jpg" 
files. The format is a placeholder to
make the doc easier to read. I'm not
concern with the actual format that's used, 
just that there's only one so the URL
is the same 100% of the time. 

  I realize that points to a potential 
  situation like `/favicon.ico` still hanging
  around. My position is that we've had
  enough experience with image formats now
  that we can safely pick a default that
  will be useful for at least a few decades. 

- I'm dropping a UUID in for a namespace
  identifier. It's as good as any, but
  should not be considered official in 
  any way at this point.
