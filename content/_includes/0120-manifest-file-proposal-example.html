<details open ><summary>MANIFEST FILE Proposal Example</summary>

<p>NOTE: I've only filled in a few avatars in the 
`default/static` section. The same format would be used
for the other sections if folks have them. They 
would, of coruse, be opt-in. So, this could
be a full example as well</p>

  [!- filter highlight_json|safe !]
  [!- include "examples/well-known-avatars-1.json" !]
  [!- endfilter !]
